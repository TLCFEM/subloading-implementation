\section{Conclusions}
In this work, the following contributions are made.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The evolution rules for back stress and elastic core are revised.
          The proposed rules are equivalent to the original proposal while remain in simple forms that are easy to understand and implement.
    \item A simpler, universal loading/unloading condition with an algebraic interpretation is proposed.
    \item The specific form of evolution function $U\left(z\right)$ is further discussed.
          For numerical robustness and stability, functions that do not meet the `strong' numerical continuity condition are recommended.
    \item A reference efficient implementation is presented.
\end{enumerate}

The subloading surface model for metal has been implemented in \texttt{suanPan} \citep{Chang2022}.
